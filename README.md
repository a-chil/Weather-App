# Weather-App
Weather GUI app which displays weather based on location entered. Utilizes OpenWeatherMap API along with python requests to get data. For more information about the API: https://openweathermap.org/api

Make sure to include the country in case a city name has been reused. For example: "London, UK" in the input field.

If you want to change the units of temperature, do so by replacing the metrics parameter for the URL.

# Note
User specific API key from OpenWeatherMap is required. The empty quotes are noted with comments as to where the API key must go.
